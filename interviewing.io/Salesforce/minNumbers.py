Given dollar_bills = [1,5,10,50,100] and given a value, what is the minumum
number of dollar bills we need to make that number (Assume operation sum)

Example:
    x = 105
    x = 100 + 5 (minimum number of dollar bills = 2)
    
Generalized:
    Given a number and array of numbers, what is the minumum number of elements
    from array needed such that their sum results in the given number.
    
Solution:
    Approach-1: 
        1. itertools API solution used here doesn't take into consideration that
        elements can be repeated in achieving the sum
        Example:
            x = 173
            x = 100 + 50 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1
            Here 10 is used twice and 1 thrice.
    Approach-2:
        2. greedy solution
